# firewood-supply-demand-allocation
Python implementation of a two-stage location–allocation model for firewood supply–demand matching. Faster, transparent, and more flexible than ArcGIS Location–Allocation, with demand prioritisation and distance cut-off support. Ideal for reproducible, high-resolution biomass flow analysis.
